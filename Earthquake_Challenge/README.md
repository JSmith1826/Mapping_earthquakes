# Mapping Earthquakes using Mapbox and JSONs

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourself with the Mapbox API and build a map that visualizes earthquake data gathered from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS.gov). We retrieved the data as a JSON directly from the USGS site. The data was then used to create tiles layers to display on our Mapbox map. A number of interactive elements were also added to our map including, the ability to switch between styles used for the base map, the ability to toggle map overlays and added pop up descriptors to each earthquake event with additional information including the magnitude and depth of the earthquake.

Over the course of the project we used JavaScript, the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library and the Leaflet pluggin to render our map.
